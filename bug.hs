This Haskell code attempts to use the `maximum` function on an empty list, which results in a runtime error.  The `maximum` function requires at least one element in the list; otherwise, it throws an exception.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let emptyList = []
  let maxVal = maximum emptyList  -- This line causes the error
  print maxVal
```
